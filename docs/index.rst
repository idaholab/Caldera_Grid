 Caldera_Grid
---------------

Caldera and OpenDSS co-simulation platform using HELICS 

Overview
--------------
Caldera Grid enables modeling EV charging on the electric grid. Caldera Grid co-simulation platform is built using HELICS (Hierarchical Engine for Large Scale Infrastructure Co-simulation) and cosimulates Caldera ICM with OpenDSS. The platfrom also provides an interface to apply custom control strategies to EV charge events.

 Installation
---------------
The installation approach for windows is only a suggested approach which is well tested
